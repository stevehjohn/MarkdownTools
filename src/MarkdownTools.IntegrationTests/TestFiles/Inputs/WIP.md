# This is the WIP test file for markdown tools

---

I will add types of markdown as each evaluator is implemented.

This line has `Some inline code`.

```CSharp
private void Main(string[] args)
{
    // Entrypoint to a C# console app
}
```

    private void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Entrypoint to a C# console app
    }

> This is a single blockquote

> Multiline
>
> Blockquote

>    private void Main()
>    {
>        // Handle stuff
>    }

Hmm, should probably test that paragraphs work.
This line should be the same paragraph.

This line should be separate.
